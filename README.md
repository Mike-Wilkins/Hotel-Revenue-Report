# Hotel Revenue Report

## Business Requirements
- **Is our hotel revenue growing by year?**<br/>
   We have two hotel types, so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.
- **Should we increase our parking lot size?**<br/>
   We want to understand whether there is a trend in guest with personal cars.
- **What trends can we see in the data?**<br/>
   Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
