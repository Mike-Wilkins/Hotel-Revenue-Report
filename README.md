[Objectives](https://github.com/Mike-Wilkins/Hotel-Revenue-Report/edit/main/README.md## Objectives)



## Business Requirements

As part of our company annual review, we would like to present to our stakeholders a comprehensive dashboard
detailing the business performance between 2018 and 2020. The dashboard should address the following:

- **Is our hotel revenue growing by year?**<br/>
   We have two hotel types, so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.<br/>
   As our business is represented globally, it would also be good to segment revenue by country.
- **Should we increase our parking lot size?**<br/>
   We want to understand whether there is a trend in guest with personal cars.
- **What trends can we see in the data?**<br/>
   Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.

## Data Source

- 2018 Bookings
- 2019 Bookings

## Objectives
