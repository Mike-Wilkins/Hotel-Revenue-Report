# Hotel Revenue Report

## Business Requirements

As part of our company annual review, we would like to present to our stakeholders a comprehensive dashboard
detailing the business performance between 2018 and 2020. The dashboard should address the following:

- **Is our hotel revenue growing by year?**<br/>
   We have two hotel types, so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.
   As our business is represented globally, it would also be good to segment revenue by country.
- **Should we increase our parking lot size?**<br/>
   We want to understand whether there is a trend in guest with personal cars.
- **What trends can we see in the data?**<br/>
   Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
